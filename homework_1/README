PROGRAM GUIDE
This program will show 4 different screen. The first screen is an image of a red cube, a green pyramid, and a blue diamond all slightly offset so that they are evident that they exist in 3-D space. Pressing the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard will switch between this view and ones with each shape being shown independantly.
