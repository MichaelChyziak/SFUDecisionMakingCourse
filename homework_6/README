HOMEWORK 6

SETUP
The program was run and compiled in Ubuntu 18.04 but should work in most other versions. The following commands were ran in order to get the program working:
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install freeglut3
> sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
> sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
> sudo apt-get install g++ cmake
> sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
> sudo apt-get install g++
> sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
> sudo apt-get install build-essential
> sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libglm-dev
> sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
> sudo apt-get â€“f install

PROGRAM COMPILATION AND RUNNING
The following command should be executed in order to compile the program:
> g++ prisoners.cc -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o prisoners

This should create a "prisoners" program which is ran doing the following command:
> ./prisoners

PROGRAM GUIDE
This program shows the user a matrix from the Prisoner's Dilemma Game. 
The user can either select to determine the best response strategy for each player.
The matrix can be changed in the source code.
If the matrix is one where a player doesn't have a best response strategy the program will notify the user.
The options that can be selected by the user are as follows: 
 1) Run the best response strategy for both players
 2) Close the program

EXTRA
An image (demo.png) is provided in .png format. It is an actual screenshot of the program running and showing all of the user options selected by default.
To change the matrix the user can enter the prisoners.cc file and change the payoff matrix values to get potentially different outcomes.
