HOMEWORK 3

SETUP
The program was run and compiled in Ubuntu 18.04 but should work in most other versions. The following commands were ran in order to get the program working:
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install freeglut3
> sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
> sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
> sudo apt-get install g++ cmake
> sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
> sudo apt-get install g++
> sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
> sudo apt-get install build-essential
> sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libglm-dev
> sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
> sudo apt-get â€“f install

PROGRAM COMPILATION AND RUNNING
The following command should be executed in order to compile the program:
> g++ decision_rules.cc -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o decision_rules

This should create a "decision_rules" program which is ran doing the following command:
> ./decision_rules

PROGRAM GUIDE
A program which determines which act should be chosen in the decision problem with a pre-defined 4x4 matrix. The rules are chosen by the user via the terminal.
The options that can be selected by the user are as follows: 
 1) The maximin rule
 2) The maximax rule 
 3) The minimax regret rule 
 4) The optimism-pessimism rule (alpha > 0.25)
 5) The principle of insufficient reason rule
 6) Close the program
After selecting an option it will display which act is the most optimal decision using the chosen rule and bring the user back to the menu again.

EXTRA
5 images are provided in .png format. They are actual screenshots of the program running and showing all of the options outcomes/answers. Each screenshot is a seperate option chosen, but they all end by selecting option 6, to close the program.
